NeuroMD utilizes Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES), which targets motor nerves and contracts the muscles, directly affecting the musculoskeletal system. The sensory and motor nerves are recruited with different electrical parameters, which is why NeuroMD’s NMES and TENS affect the body differently. <\/p><p>Here’s What happens:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your muscles will contract and relax 108 times over the 25-minute session.<\/li>\n<li>NeuroMD accomplishes this by stimulating deep motor nerves with clinically studied Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) parameters.<\/li>\n<li>Your pain will improve through healing damaged tissues, reducing inflammation, and strengthening your spinal stabilizing muscles.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most treatment modalities focus on masking the pain.
