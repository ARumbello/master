For example if you're having muscle spasms in your mid back you would apply the device in that area.<br/><br/>In order to obtain the best degree of pain relief with NeuroMD, we recommend the following pad placement guidelines:<br/><br/>1. Take note of exactly where your pain is located. Outline the most concise and tender area of the pain.<br/>2. The pad can be placed in one of three directions 1. vertical 2. horizontal 3. angulated.<br/>3. It is advisable not to place the pad directly over a joint such as the knee, elbow or ankle as its movement can alter the adherence of the pad.<br/>4. Increase intensity gradually as each body part will tolerate a different level of intensity<br/>Note: Pad placement as well as Intensity level tolerance varies from person to person. We recommend following our guidelines and do what feels best for you.</p>",
